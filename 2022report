##Phase of work:
Maintenance 

##Activities:
Primary modes of collaboration have been a combination of weekly meetings and regular email discussion. 
Development of manuscripts and other products happens via shared documents (e.g., Google Docs).  

The most important issues related to Citizen Science that we've discussed, and that will be a focus of our 
2022 conference symposium, are data quality and datauser trust in citizen scientist-derived data.

Due to COVID-related travel restrictions all meetings, including participation in the 2022 conference, are remote.

Co-conveners Brenton and Stevenson are also active participants in the Humboldt Core Group and provide cross-pollination 
with this citizen science IG. 
Outside of TDWG groups, we also mingle with our regional and national citizen societies, especially on topics that relate 
to data standards.

##Accomplishments:
We don't have any completed projects to point to/ 

##Plans for next calendar year
We plan to continue our weekly video meetings which are open to all interested.
We also plan to complete a short paper highlighting a few of the major topics in citizen science data standards.
